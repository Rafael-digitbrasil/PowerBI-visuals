# Drill down in a visualization

When a visual has a hierarchy, you can drill down to reveal additional details. For example, you might have a visualization that looks at Olympic medal count by a hierarchy made up of sport, discipline, and event. 
By default, the visualization would show medal count by sport -- gymnastics, skiing, aquatics, etc. 
But because it has a hierarchy, selecting one of the visual elements (such as a bar, line, or bubble), would display an increasingly more-detailed picture.
